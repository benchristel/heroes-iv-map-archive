# Map Desiderata

## Goals

- Exploration
- Sense of place
- Surprise
- Leveling / progression
- Variety of creatures / hero types (maybe achieved through multiple plays?)
- Multiplayer- and AI-compatible
- Non-conquest victory
- Clear sense of who is ahead

## Anti-Goals

- Micromanaging small armies to do things like buy creatures and items
- TPKs / getting knocked out of a multiplayer game
- Traveling for many turns to get to the next destination
- Managing more than 3 towns
- Superhero barbarians
- Permanent hero imprisonment

## Possible Patterns

- Start on grass
- Chapters / Boundaries
- No creature dwellings outside towns
- No Caravans
- Armies without heroes can't move through certain border gates
- Random monsters attack armies without heroes
- Heroes who know Town Gate
- Reduced creature growth in towns to make the game more hero-focused
- Portals home
- Scoreboard
- Emperor's Treasure
- Oracles
- Ring of Greater Negation
- Asymmetrical objectives? (good guys have shielded towns and must win by conquest; bad guys trying to collect artifacts)
